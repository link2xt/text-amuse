<em>This should</em> <em> <em>compile</em>

You can also use the <code><verbatim><code></verbatim></code> tag to indicate code and monospace
text. This is handy for regions that have an “=” in them.

If the “*” confuse you or the preview is screwed up, you can use
inline tag <code><verbatim><em></verbatim></code> and <code><verbatim><strong></verbatim></code>, which are guaranteed to work in any case.
