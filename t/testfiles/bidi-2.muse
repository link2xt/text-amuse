The Persian language is classified as a continuation of Middle
Persian, the official religious and literary language of the Sasanian
Empire, itself a continuation of Old Persian, the language of the
Achaemenid Empire.[15][16][17] Its grammar is similar to that of many
contemporary European languages.[18] A Persian-speaking person may be
referred to as Persophone.[19]

There are approximately 110 million Persian speakers worldwide, with
the language holding official status in Iran, Afghanistan, and
Tajikistan. For centuries, Persian has also been a prestigious
cultural language in other regions of Western Asia, Central Asia, and
South Asia by the various empires based in the regions.[20]

Persian has had a considerable (mainly lexical) influence on
neighboring languages, particularly the Turkic languages in Central
Asia, Caucasus, and Anatolia, neighboring Iranian languages, as well
as Armenian, Georgian, and Indo-Aryan languages, especially Urdu (a
register of Hindustani). It also exerted some influence on Arabic,
particularly Bahrani Arabic,[21] while borrowing much vocabulary from
it after the Arab conquest of Iran.[15][18][22][23][24][25][26]

With a long history of literature in the form of Middle Persian before
Islam, Persian was the first language in the Muslim world to break
through Arabic's monopoly on writing, and the writing of poetry in
Persian was established as a court tradition in many eastern
courts.[20] Some of the famous works of Persian literature are the
Shahnameh of Ferdowsi, the works of Rumi, the Rubaiyat of Omar
Khayyam, the Panj Ganj of Nizami Ganjavi, the Divān of Hafez and the
two miscellanea of prose and verse by Saadi Shirazi, the Gulistan and
the Bustan.
